## Computer Vision Basics
In this section, I delve into the fundamental concepts of Computer Vision. It includes topics like image processing techniques, feature extraction, and basic image recognition algorithms.

## Deep Computer Vision
Here, I explore more advanced topics in Computer Vision using deep learning techniques. It covers neural network architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their applications in image and video recognition.

## Transfer Learning
In this section, I showcase my expertise in transfer learning, a method that adapts pre-trained models to new tasks. This approach is particularly effective in dealing with limited datasets.

## Case Studies

### CIFAR10 Classification
A detailed study on the CIFAR10 dataset, implementing various models to classify images into 10 different categories.

### Food Image Classification
My approach to classifying various food items using deep learning techniques. This project highlights the challenges of working with diverse food images.

### Monkey Species Classification
A unique project where I developed a model to classify images of different monkey species. It demonstrates my ability to handle classification tasks with fine-grained categories.

### Plant Seedling Classification
In this project, I focused on classifying different types of plant seedlings. It’s an excellent example of applying Computer Vision in the field of agriculture.
